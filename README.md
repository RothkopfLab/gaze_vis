The following Matlab function generates the visualizations of gaze target sequences used in:

The idea is to generate a visualization that is a two-dmensional image from the three-dimensional image cube of a sequence of gaze targets. The two spatial dimensions are reduced to a single dimension, the vertical direction, by spiraling outward from the gaze target. The horizontal dimension corresponds to time.

Figure 2 of the orignal paper was obtained using this function:
